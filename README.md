# HuggingFace ðŸ¤— Library: Ultimate Companion for NLP Challenges

While my expertise lies in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, I've developed a keen interest in Large Language Models. Currently engrossed in 'Natural Language Processing with Transformers,' I find the content engaging. I've compiled the book's code examples in a repository, augmenting them with additional experiments for each unit.

I aim to enrich the Jupyter notebooks with extra insights, serving as a valuable resource for comprehending the book's concepts. Transitioning from Computer Vision to text processing metrics like accuracy in text summarization has been challenging, but the book's explanations are exceptionally clear and accessible.
